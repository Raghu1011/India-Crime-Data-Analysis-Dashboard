## 📘 Project Overview
The **India Crime Data Analysis Dashboard** is a Tableau-based visualization system that enables interactive exploration of crime patterns across major Indian cities.  
Developed over three project phases — **Planning**, **Decision Making**, and **Dashboard Implementation** — the dashboard integrates temporal, demographic, and geographic insights to support **law enforcement**, **crime analysts**, **public safety administrators**, and **city planners**.

It visualizes trends in crime frequency, weapon use, victim demographics, and case resolutions to enhance **data-driven decision-making** and improve **public safety strategy** and **urban planning**.

## 🧩 Project Phases

### **Phase 1: Planning**
- Defined the **project scope**, dataset structure, and primary objectives.  
- Identified key attributes such as:
  - *City, Crime Code, Crime Description, Victim Gender, Weapon Used, Crime Domain, Case Closed, Date Reported, Victim Age,* and *Police Deployed.*  
- Specified dashboard user roles:
  - **Law Enforcement Officers** – Identify crime hotspots and allocate resources.  
  - **Crime Analysts** – Perform in-depth pattern and trend analysis.  
  - **Public Safety Administrators** – Create data-driven policy reports.  
  - **City Planners** – Integrate crime data for safer infrastructure design.  
- Established 10 key analytical questions for visualization.

### **Phase 2: Decision Making**
- Selected **Tableau** as the visualization tool for its scalability and interactive features.  
- Performed **data preprocessing**:
  - Cleaned missing values.  
  - Standardized and normalized numeric fields.  
  - Validated categorical attributes like *Crime Description* and *Crime Type*.  
- Determined optimal chart types:
  - **Bar Charts** – Top crime types, closure rates.  
  - **Maps** – Geographic distribution.  
  - **Line Charts** – Monthly trends and resolution times.  
  - **Stacked Bars** – Crime by time and day.  
  - **Scatter Plots** – Correlation of police deployment vs. crime rate.  
- Added **interactive filters**:
  - Date range sliders, geographic filters, demographic filters, and case status toggles.

### **Phase 3: Dashboard Implementation**
- Built the **final Tableau dashboard** combining all visual elements and user interactivity.  
- Integrated the following key visualizations:
  1. **Top 5 Crime Types** – Identifies most frequent crimes.  
  2. **Crime Distribution Across Cities** – Highlights hotspots geographically.  
  3. **Monthly Trends** – Tracks crime frequency over time.  
  4. **Time of Day vs. Day of Week** – Reveals temporal crime patterns.  
  5. **Weapon Usage** – Shows common weapons in violent crimes.  
  6. **Case Closure Rates** – Displays efficiency of investigation outcomes.  
  7. **Victim Age & Gender** – Analyzes demographic vulnerabilities.  
  8. **Average Case Resolution Time** – Detects slow or efficient case types.  
  9. **Police Deployment vs. Crime Rate** – Evaluates operational effectiveness.  

- Added **interactive features**:
  - Filters by **city, crime category, gender, and time period**.  
  - **Dynamic maps and tooltips** for contextual insights.  
  - **Hover interactions** revealing details without clutter.

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Certain cities exhibit **higher crime density**, suggesting targeted resource allocation.  
- **Violent crimes** and **property thefts** dominate urban areas.  
- **Police deployment** correlates moderately with reduced crime in some regions.  
- **Weapon usage trends** provide valuable data for law enforcement strategy.  
- **Temporal patterns** highlight late-night and weekend spikes.
